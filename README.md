## Description and details
Croduino Basic is 100% Arduino compatible board made in EU(Croatia), created to promote Arduino culture in Croatia(well, it's named CROduino). Install Arduino software, plug it into USB and start DIY-ing!

It has even more analog inputs than Arduino Uno, features FTDI USB chip and built-in voltage regulator. The main difference from original Arduino and Croduino is size. Croduino is just 5cm x 3cm which makes it very easy to implement into projects. More:

- Atmega328 microcontroller(32kB flash, 2kB RAM, 1kB EEPROM)
- FTDI USB converter
- 22 I/O pins, 14 digital I/O, 6 PWM, 8 analog pins
- Size only 3 x 5cm (1.2 x 2 inch)
- LED light on the 13th pin
- Voltage regulator for possibility of external charging
- Made in Croatia
- Free lifetime technical support at techsupport@e-radionica.com
